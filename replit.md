# Project Documentation

## Overview

This repository appears to be empty or newly initialized. This document will serve as a guide for the coding agent and will need to be updated once the project structure and code are added.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

*To be determined once project files are added*

The architecture will be documented here after analyzing:
- Frontend framework/technology choices
- Backend structure and API design
- Database selection and schema design
- Authentication mechanisms
- Third-party service integrations

## Key Components

*To be documented once codebase is established*

Key components will include:
- Main application modules
- Database models/schemas
- API endpoints
- Authentication system
- UI components (if applicable)

## Data Flow

*To be mapped once application structure is clear*

This section will describe:
- How data moves through the system
- Request/response patterns
- Data transformation processes
- Integration points between components

## External Dependencies

*To be cataloged once package.json/requirements files are present*

External dependencies will include:
- Runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies
- Third-party APIs
- External services

## Deployment Strategy

*To be defined based on project requirements*

Deployment considerations will cover:
- Target platform (web, mobile, desktop)
- Build process
- Environment configuration
- Hosting requirements

**Note**: This document should be updated as the project develops and architectural decisions are made. The coding agent should refer to this file for understanding the overall system design and user preferences.
